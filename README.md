# Machine-Learning-with-Python

I've earned the certification of this course (Machine Learning with Python). [You can verify it on this page.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/vanastasia/machine-learning-with-python-v7)

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from the freeCodeCAmp Machine Learning with Python course:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors**  
   Developed a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against four different bots, achieving at least a 60% win rate. The solution used strategic adaptations based on the opponents' gameplay patterns, illustrating algorithmic decision-making.
   
2. **Cat and Dog Image Classifier**  
   Created a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs, achieving an accuracy of over 63%. This project introduced me to image processing and computer vision techniques.

3. **Book Recommendation Engine using KNN**  
   Implemented a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors on the Book-Crossings dataset. This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of distance-based similarity measures to suggest books.

4. **Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator**  
   Built a regression model to predict healthcare costs based on individual features such as age, BMI, and smoking status. The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of under $3,500, emphasizing regression analysis and model evaluation.

5. **Neural Network SMS Text Classifier**  
   Designed a neural network to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." The model provided predictions with a likelihood score and classification output, demonstrating text processing and binary classification.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Introduced to core machine learning concepts, including supervised learning, regression, and classification.  
- Hands-on experience with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for implementing machine learning pipelines.  
- Gained an understanding of both traditional ML models (e.g., KNN, linear regression) and deep learning techniques (e.g., neural networks).
